# Runtime dependencies for eudr-dmi-gil
#
# Keep this file minimal: only add packages that are directly imported by the
# runtime code (src/) or required by scripts that are part of the supported
# operator workflow.
#
# Currently, this repository snapshot uses only Python's standard library.

# Packaging note:
# - The primary install path is `pip install -e ".[dev]"` via pyproject.toml.
# - Add runtime dependencies to `pyproject.toml` when code in `src/` imports them.
